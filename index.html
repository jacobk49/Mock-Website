            <h3>About Nicola</h3>
            <p>Nicola Miers has been playing the piano as far back as she can remember, and took up teaching in her early teens to share her passion with her contemporaries. Soon she was teaching students far older than her with stunning effect and before long she was enrolled at the local university to persue a degree in music. She achieved a 2:1 all whilst teaching and playing in various bands on the side. She has raised 3 children whilst teaching at local schools, as well as giving private lessons in her aptly named "music room", home to her beloved grand piano. She is currently seeking to expand her pool of talented students. Do you have what it takes? If so fill in an <a href="#form">enquiry</a> or contact her <a href="#footer">here</a></p>
